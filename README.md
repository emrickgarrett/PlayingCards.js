# PlayingCards.js

## Description

A general library for creating playing card games in Javascript. The base library is simply playingcards.js in the Javascript folder, while there will be several addon files such as gametemplate.js that will include less general logic such as turn logic/player logic.

To use simply download the project and open either gametypeExample.html or genericCardsexample.html

The generic example is a simple card game using the base library, while the gametype example uses the base library plus the extension to change the game type/deck size to uno. If you only wanted a library to create a deck and display basic playing cards without any additional features/funtionality, you won't need the game template library.

The gametemplate.js will feature some addons such as a GameMaster (manages turns, score, players, game flow), Chat system (you will need to implement any backend functionality if it's online yourself!), AI (will be basic AI that will contain customizable logic),  and Player objects (will do things such as displaying a UI for the player as well as other players... also merging with game master for turn control/moves)
