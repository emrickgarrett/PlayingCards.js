# PlayingCards.js

## Description

A general library for creating playing card games in Javascript. The base library is simply playingcards.js in the Javascript folder, while there will be several addon files such as gametemplate.js that will include less general logic such as turn logic/player logic.

To use simply download the project and open either gametypeExample.html or genericCardsexample.html

The generic example is a simple card game using the base library, while the gametype example uses the base library plus the extension to change the game type/deck size to uno.
